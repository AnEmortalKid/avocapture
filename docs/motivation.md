# Motivation

This tool was built to improve on a workflow when reporting bugs to the [StarCitizen: IssueCouncil](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115009643527-Bug-Reports-Using-the-Issue-Council) which consisted of:

1. Setup OBS replay buffer and capture a replay on a hotkey when a bug occurs
2. Once ready to report, review clips and rename the replays
3. Upload all the desired replays to youtube
4. Interact with the issue council now that the replays are uploaded

Due to YouTube rate limits, I currently couldnt feasibly do point `3` since I often upload more than 5 replays and each upload has a cost of `1600` units (with a 24 hour `10,000` unit limit).
