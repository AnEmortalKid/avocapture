# Roadmap

Captures planned features and their barriers to implementation.

## Future

### Code Signing

* Producing signed builds requires a certificate, which I'll look to acquire so the suspicious download of exe's is less suspicious. See [issue/10](https://github.com/AnEmortalKid/avocapture/issues/10)


### Overlay

* Attempt to setup an [overlay window](https://github.com/TheMightyPenguin/electron-overlay-window) so the target capturable can be in fullscreen mode.
  * This might require a setting for which window to overlay on top of.
