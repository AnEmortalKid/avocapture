- Callback/way to track a replay "uploaded" , pass something to uploader to NotifyCompletion
  - Main UI updates state with a little Green checkmark or something

## extensions

- look into ability to `require` things that use `import/export`

## UI

- Figure out sandbox for extensions and apis

## Extension Manager App

- Update Menu
- Install extensions/Uninstall extensions
- Show dithered extensions

## HotkeyDetector

- OBS seems to not save the replay buffer until after the timeout expires? maybe we need to do a rename -> then apply rename to the detected file?
